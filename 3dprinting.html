<h1>Kyler's Hobby: 3D Printing</h1></br>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  3D printing is the process of creating a physical object from a 3D model using an additive process.
  3D printing has applications in rapid prototyping, the hobby space, and the production of final products.

  There are various materials and methods for 3D printing, each with its uses, advantages, and disadvantages.

  The two most common consumer 3D printing technologies are FDM 3D printing, LCD printing.
  Kyler uses both types of 3D printing for rapid prototyping for school projects and hobby use.
</p> </br>

<h2>FDM Printing</h2>
<h3>What Is FDM Printing?</h3>
<p>
  Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is a method of additive manufacturing where the material is extruded through a nozzle and
  fused with previously placed material. In a 3D printer, a filament passes through a heated extruder that deposits the material
  as the extruder moves.

</p></br>

<h3>Materials</h3>
<p>
    FDM 3D printers use materials ranging from plastics to metal and foods such as chocolate.
    The most common consumer materials are plastics.
</p>

<h4>Commoningly Used Materials</h4>
<ul>
  <li>PLA</dt>
  <dd>Polylactic Acid, PLA, is the most popular filament choice. The material is made from corn starches and is the easiest to print and use.
      It is not the strongest material and can deform at warm temperatures.
      It is a good material for scale models and hobby prints.
  </dd>

  <li>ABS</dt>
  <dd> Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, ABS, is a thermoplastic that is impact and heat-resistant.
    ABS can be difficult to print because ABS is prone to warping when the environment changes. ABS also releases fumes
      which can be problematic for individuals sensitive to them.
  </dd>
  <li>PETG</dt>
  <dd>Polyethylene Terephthalate glycol-modified (PETG) filament is a durable food-safe material.
    The biggest hurdle with PETG is getting access to a printer that can warm up to the temperatures
    required to melt it.
  </dd>
  <li>TPU</dt>
  <dd>Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) is a flexible and chemical resistant material that can withstand deformations. TPU can be difficult to use because it absorbs moisture from the air more than other materials, resulting in failed prints with more physical defects.
      To avoid this, TPU needs to be stored in a container with little moisture or must be dehydrated on occasion.
  </dd>
</ul>

</br>

<h3>Machines</h3>
<p>
    3D printers come in all shapes and sizes and can have features designed to simplify the process of printing. Some higher-end printers use higher quality materials to reduce the odds of failure and the frequency of maintenance. Overall, printers with a lower cost may perform similarly to more expensive printers
  but may not be as beginner-friendly due to increased maintenance.

</br>

<h3>Safety</h3>
<p>
  FDM 3D printing is generally safe, but accidents can occur.
  One of the more common accidents is burns from the nozzle.
  The nozzle of the 3D printer will reach temperatures of at least 180-200 C (356 - 392F).
  In addition to burns, fires could occur if thermal regulation fails or the printer fails,
  but this is unlikely when taking proper care. Finally, certain materials can produce negative side effects, so it is best to research materials before printing.
  </p></br>

<h3>Creating A Print</h3>
<p>Before you use the printer, you need to take a 3D model and convert it into path instructions the printer can read.
  The instructions are the GCODE, and the program that creates this file is called a slicer.</p><br>

<h4>Slicer</h4>
<p>Slicers are programs that will take a 3D model and generate the paths necessary for the printer to travel to create the model.
  Some slicers are proprietary to the printer, and some support many printers.
  One popular slicer is Cura which supports many printers and is beginner-friendly with the ability to be fined tuned by experienced users.
</p>

<h5>Importing The Model</h5>
<p>When you import a model into Cura, it can be resized, rotated, and moved to accommodate multiple models.
  The model should be flat against the print bed, or a majority of it should.
</p>

<img src="images/3DPrinting/Cura.png" alt="Cura" width = "300" >

<h5>Common Settings</h5>
<p>Slicers come with settings that will determine the quality of the print, configure settings for the material used, and the support structure.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hot End Temperature</dt>
  <dd>The hot end temperature is the temperature for the hot end or nozzle.
The hot end temperature varies on the material. For example, the hot end temp for PLA is 180-200C.</dd>

  <li>Bed Temperature</dt>
  <dd>The bed temperature is the temperature of the heated print bed.
    This varies on the material. For example, PLA is 50-60C.
  </dd>
  <li>Layer Height</dt>
  <dd>The layer height determines how tall a layer is in the model. Generally, lower layer height increases the quality but increases print time.
     Depending on the size of the model, different layer heights are necessary.
  </dd>
  <li>Infill</dt>
  <dd>Infill is a measure of how 'solid' the material is. A higher infill means the model will require more filament to print.
     Common infill percentages are 20%, but the infill should be altered depending on the type of object made.
  </dd>
  <li>Supports</dt>
  <dd>Supports are necessary when  parts of the model hang off the model without material underneath. Generally, you want to turn on supports to prevent print failures. Slicers occasionally add unecessary supports, but the slicer can modified to remove these.
      There are two types of supports, normal (rectangular) and tree. Tree supports wrap around the model to provide support, and rectangular supports are more like
      pillars of material. One support may work better for some models. Organic models often work better with tree supports on average, but it is highly dependent on the exact model.
  </dd>
  <li>...and more.</dt>
  <dd> Many other settings fine-tune your prints, but these are the basics.
  </dd>

<h5>Slicing The Model</h5>
<p>Once the model is imported and the settings configured, the model is ready for slicing. Click on the slice button, and the slicer will analyze the model to generate
    the paths for the printer.
</p>

</br>

<h4>Printing The Model</h4>
<p>The steps to print the model varies from printer to printer, but in general, insert the storage medium into the printer, and pre-heat the printer.
Once the printer is pre-heated, go to the menu to start the print and wait for your model.

<h2>Resin (LCD) Printing</h2>
<h3>What Is LCD Printing?</h3>
<p>
  Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) printing uses an LCD screen as a light source to cure the resin. The part is printed one layer at a time
  and an LCD screen will illuminate to cure the pixels for that layer.</p> <br>
<p>
  The build plate allows the layers of the print to build on each other. The inverted build plate allows new material to be added onto the top and helps excess resin drip off.
  The vat is a container that stores the resin. <br><br>

<img src="images/3DPrinting/LCDPrinting.png" alt="LCDPrinter" width = "300" height= "300" > <br>
Common LCD Printer Process (Credits: Phrozen 3D) <br><br>

Resin printing performs the best with high-detail 3D prints, such as miniature figurines for board games such as Warhammer.
Resin printers are also used for prototyping collectible figurines before they are mass manufactured or sent as is.

There are other methods for 3D printing using resin, but LCD printing will be the primary focus of this webpage.
</p></br>

<!-- Left off-->
<h3>Materials</h3>
<p>The primary material for LCD resin printers is photopolymer resin which will cure when exposed to ultraviolet light.
Resin is the standard for the printers, but there are different types of resins avaliable for purchase.
The biggest difference is in the color, some resins are completly different colors, but some can change color in response
to heat or are transulcent. The resin can also differ in strength, some claim to be 'ABS-Like' in strength and some require
different methods for cleaning, more on that in the cleanup section.
</p></br>

<h3>Machines</h3>
<p>When choosing a printer, the primary differences will be in the size of the printer and the screen. Some printers have a larger volume compared
  to others with a larger build area and height contributing to a larger volume. The other difference is in the LCD screen, more expensive printers have
high resolution screens which allow for higher detail prints and some screens allow for faster printing. Depending on your budget and expected print size,
some sizes will be more appropriate for your project.</p>

<h3>Safety</h3>
<p>3D printing with resin is far more dangerous than with PLA and many more safety measures are necessary.
Resin is an allergen which means prolonged exposure will result in irritation and allergic reactions when in contact with resin.
If you come into contact with resin, likely resin will get onto your hands or fumes given off by the resin is inhaled.
Resin provides a foul odor but becomes undetectable after exposure.</p>
</br>
<p>To protect yourself against resin, PPE should be used alongside other safety measures.
Common saftey materials include Nitrile disposable gloves, safety glasses/goggles, and a respirator.
If resin gets into contact with the skin, wash the affected area with soap and water and it is best to print in a well-ventilated room to reduce exposure to resin fumes.

<h3>Creating A Print</h3>
<p>The process for creating a resin 3D print is similiar in the steps but there are more steps in the cleanup of the print and in the execution of some steps.</p></br>

<h4>Slicer</h4>
<p>There are a few different slicer programs, but the one we will be looking at is Chitubox which supports many different LCD printers.
</p>

<h5>Importing The Model</h5>
<p>When you import a model into Chitubox, it can be resized, rotated, and moved to accommodate multiple models.
  The print should be oriented to reduce the number of supports on delicate or important features (more on this in the supports section).
  If possible, increase the area of the model in each layer which will help reduce print time since the time of the print is dependent on the layers of the final print.
</p>

<img src="images/3DPrinting/Chitubox.png" alt="Chitubox" width = "300" >

<h5>Printer Settings</h5>
<p></p>

<h5>Supports</h5>
<p>Resin supports require more work compared to FDM printing because they often require the user to place.
  There is no all size fits all approach to addings supports automatically because differnt sized supports are necessary for different features of the print.
The problem with auto-supports is they are all the same size and auto-supports can miss locations that require support, producing islands or weak area that can break during printing.</p>

<img src="images/3DPrinting/Island.png" alt="Island" width = "300" >

<br> <p>There are three types of supports which can be tailored to a specifc print. Here is a general overview of them.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Light Supports</dt>
  <dd>Light supports are often used on delicate portions of a model that can break easily because they produce the least damage when they are removed.
    Smaller models can be supported entirly with light supports, but as the size of the model increases, so does the liklihood of the model breaking.
    Best practices include using the light supports to support delicate portions while other supports help with supporting the overall model. </dd>

  <li>Medium Supports</dt>
  <dd>The bed temperature is the temperature of the heated print bed.
    This varies on the material. For example, PLA is 50-60C.
  </dd>
  <li>Heavy Supports</dt>
  <dd>The layer height determines how tall a layer is in the model. Generally, lower layer height increases the quality but increases print time.
     Depending on the size of the model, different layer heights are necessary.
  </dd>
</ul>

<p>In practice, auto-supports are good to prepare the majority of the print, and then the user can add, edit, and remove any necessary supports.
The support process can take some time especially for beginners as it is trial and error until users become comfortable adding supports and have
enough experince to identify areas the print will likely fail. Once the model has been fully supported, it is time to print.</p>

<h5>Slicing The Model</h5>
<p>Once the model is imported and the settings configured, the model is ready for slicing. Click on the slice button, and the slicer will analyze the model to generate
    the paths for the printer.
</p>

<img src="images/3DPrinting/ResinPreview.png" alt="Print Preview" width = "300" height= "300" >
</br>

<h4>Printing The Model</h4>
<p>The steps to print the model begin with loading the sliced model on a USB drive and inserting it into the printer. Next, the printer is turned on and the vat is filled with resin.
  Always check to make sure the build plate is securred and then you can begin the print and wait. Don't forget your PPE.
