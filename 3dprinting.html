<h1>Kyler's Hobby: 3D Printing</h1></br>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  3D printing is the process of creating a physical object from a 3D model using an additive process.
  3D printing has applications in rapid prototyping, the hobby space, and the production of final products.

  There are various materials and methods for 3D printing, each with its uses, advantages, and disadvantages.

  The two most common consumer 3D printing technologies are FDM 3D printing, LCD printing.
  Kyler uses both types of 3D printing for rapid prototyping for school projects and hobby use.
</p> </br>

<h2>FDM Printing</h2>
<h3>What Is FDM Printing?</h3>
<p>
  Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is a method of additive manufacturing where the material is extruded through a nozzle and
  fused with previously placed material. In a 3D printer, a filament passes through a heated extruder that deposits the material
  as the extruder moves.

<h3>Materials</h3>
<p>
    FDM 3D printers use materials ranging from plastics to metal and foods such as chocolate.
    The most common consumer materials are plastics.
</p>

<h4>Commoningly Used Materials</h4>
<ul>
  <li>PLA</dt>
  <dd>Polylactic Acid, PLA, is the most popular filament choice. The material is made from corn starches and is the easiest to print and use.
      It is not the strongest material and can deform at warm temperatures.
      It is a good material for scale models and hobby prints.
  </dd>

  <li>ABS</dt>
  <dd> Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, ABS, is a thermoplastic that is impact and heat-resistant.
    ABS can be difficult to print because ABS is prone to warping when the environment changes. ABS also releases fumes
      which can be problematic for individuals sensitive to them.
  </dd>
  <li>PETG</dt>
  <dd>Polyethylene Terephthalate glycol-modified (PETG) filament is a durable food-safe material.
    The biggest hurdle with PETG is getting access to a printer that can warm up to the temperatures
    required to melt it.
  </dd>
  <li>TPU</dt>
  <dd>Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) is a flexible and chemical resistant material that can withstand deformations. TPU can be difficult to use because it absorbs moisture from the air more than other materials, resulting in failed prints with more physical defects.
      To avoid this, TPU needs to be stored in a container with little moisture or must be dehydrated on occasion.
  </dd>
</ul>

</br>

<h3>Machines</h3>
<p>
    3D printers come in all shapes and sizes and can have features designed to simplify the process of printing. Some higher-end printers use higher quality materials to reduce the odds of failure and the frequency of maintenance. Overall, printers with a lower cost may perform similarly to more expensive printers
  but may not be as beginner-friendly due to increased maintenance.

  </tr>

</br>

<h3>Safety</h3>
<p>
  FDM 3D printing is generally safe, but accidents can occur.
  One of the more common accidents is burns from the nozzle.
  The nozzle of the 3D printer will reach temperatures of at least 180-200 C (356 - 392F).
  In addition to burns, fires could occur if thermal regulation fails or the printer fails,
  but this is unlikely when taking proper care. Finally, certain materials can produce negative side effects, so it is best to research materials before printing.
  </p></br>

<h3>Creating A Print</h3>
<p>Before you use the printer, you need to take a 3D model and convert it into path instructions the printer can read.
  The instructions are the GCODE, and the program that creates this file is called a slicer.</p><br>

<h4>Slicer</h4>
<p>Slicers are programs that will take a 3D model and generate the paths necessary for the printer to travel to create the model.
  Some slicers are proprietary to the printer, and some support many printers.
  One popular slicer is Cura which supports many printers and is beginner-friendly with the ability to be fined tuned by experienced users.
</p>

<h5>Importing The Model</h5>
<p>When you import a model into Cura, it can be resized, rotated, and moved to accommodate multiple models.
  The model should be flat against the print bed, or a majority of it should.
</p>

<img src="images/3DPrinting/Cura.png" alt="Cura" width = "300" >

<h5>Common Settings</h5>
<p>Slicers come with settings that will determine the quality of the print, configure settings for the material used, and the support structure.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hot End Temperature</dt>
  <dd>The hot end temperature is the temperature for the hot end or nozzle.
The hot end temperature varies on the material. For example, the hot end temp for PLA is 180-200C.</dd>

  <li>Bed Temperature</dt>
  <dd>The bed temperature is the temperature of the heated print bed.
    This varies on the material. For example, PLA is 50-60C.
  </dd>
  <li>Layer Height</dt>
  <dd>The layer height determines how tall a layer is in the model. Generally, lower layer height increases the quality but increases print time.
     Depending on the size of the model, different layer heights are necessary.
  </dd>
  <li>Infill</dt>
  <dd>Infill is a measure of how 'solid' the material is. A higher infill means the model will require more filament to print.
     Common infill percentages are 20%, but the infill should be altered depending on the type of object made.
  </dd>
  <li>Supports</dt>
  <dd>Supports are necessary when  parts of the model hang off the model without material underneath. Generally, you want to turn on supports to prevent print failures. Slicers occasionally add unecessary supports, but the slicer can modified to remove these.
      There are two types of supports, normal (rectangular) and tree. Tree supports wrap around the model to provide support, and rectangular supports are more like
      pillars of material. One support may work better for some models. Organic models often work better with tree supports on average, but it is highly dependent on the exact model.
  </dd>
  <li>...and more.</dt>
  <dd> Many other settings fine-tune your prints, but these are the basics.
  </dd>

    <td><img src="images/3DPrinting/TreeSupport.png" alt="Tree Support" width = "300" height= "300"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h5>Slicing The Model</h5>
<p>Once the model is imported and the settings configured, the model is ready for slicing. Click on the slice button, and the slicer will analyze the model to generate
    the paths for the printer.
</p>

</br>

<h4>Printing The Model</h4>
<p>The steps to print the model varies from printer to printer, but in general, insert the storage medium into the printer, and pre-heat the printer.
Once the printer is pre-heated, go to the menu to start the print and wait for your model.

<h2>Resin (LCD) Printing</h2>
<h3>What Is LCD Printing?</h3>
<p>
Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) printing uses an LCD screen as a light source to cure resin. The part is printed one layer at a time
and an LCD screen will illuminate the pixels that need to be cured for that layer. <br>

The object is printed onto the inverted build plate (platform) which allows new material to be added onto the top and helps excess resin drip off.
The vat is a container that stores the resin. <br><br>

Common LCD Printer Process (Credits: Quickast Makers Space) <br><br>

Resin printing is intended for high detail 3D prints and often used for printing miniature figurines for board games such as Warhammer.
Resin printers are also used for prototyping collectible figurines before they are mass manufactuered, or will be sent as is.


There are other methods for 3D printing using resin, but LCD printing will be the primary focus for this webpage
</p></br>

<h3>Materials</h3>
<p>The primary material for LCD resin printers is photopolymer resin which will cure when exposed to ultraviolet light.
Resin is the standard for the printers, but there are different types of resins avaliable for purchase.
The biggest difference is in the color, some resins are completly different colors, but some can change color in response
to heat or are transulcent. The resin can also differ in strength, some claim to be 'ABS-Like' in strength and some require
different methods for cleaning, more on that in the cleanup section.
