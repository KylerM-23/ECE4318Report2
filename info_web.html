                                   However, he did not dare to list Assembly as a skill on his resume right after. Never again.

                                   forced to run away. As he was running, Lyndon was running out of breath. To save face and look cool,
                                   he stopped running, turned around, and told his samurai friends he will hold the demons back while they
                                   escaped. Obivously, Lyndon died and the dream ended.
